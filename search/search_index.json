Create a file called compose-override.yml in the main directory, and place your modifications into it. These changes will be merged into the docker-compose.yml file next time you run the build script. The compose-override.yml file has been added to the .gitignore file, so it shouldn't be touched when upgrading IOTstack. It has been added to the backup script, and so will be included when you back up and restore IOTstack. Always test your backups though! New versions of IOTstack may break previous builds. How it works After the build process has been completed, a temporary docker compose file is created in the tmp directory. The script then checks if compose-override.yml exists: If it exists, then continue to step 3 If it does not exist, copy the temporary docker compose file to the main directory and rename it to docker-compose.yml . Using the yaml_merge.py script, merge both the compose-override.yml and the temporary docker compose file together; Using the temporary file as the default values and interating through each level of the yaml structure, check to see if the compose-override.yml has a value set. Output the final file to the main directory, calling it docker-compose.yml . A word of caution If you specify an override for a service, and then rebuild the docker-compose.yml file, but deselect the service from the list, then the YAML merging will still produce that override. For example, lets say NodeRed was selected to have have the following override specified in compose-override.yml : services: nodered: restart: always When rebuilding the menu, ensure to have NodeRed service always included because if it's no longer included, the only values showing in the final docker-compose.yml file for NodeRed will be the restart key and its value. Docker Compose will error with the following message: Service nodered has neither an image nor a build context specified. At least one must be provided. When attempting to bring the services up with docker-compose up -d . Either remove the override for NodeRed in compose-override.yml and rebuild the stack, or ensure that NodeRed is built with the stack to fix this. Examples Overriding default settings Lets assume you put the following into the compose-override.yml file: services: mosquitto: ports: - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 Normally the mosquitto service would be built like this inside the docker-compose.yml file: version: '3.6' services: mosquitto: container_name: mosquitto image: eclipse-mosquitto restart: unless-stopped user: \"1883\" ports: - 1883:1883 - 9001:9001 volumes: - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./volumes/mosquitto/pwfile:/mosquitto/pwfile - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl Take special note of the ports list. If you run the build script with the compose-override.yml file in place, and open up the final docker-compose.yml file, you will notice that the port list have been replaced with the ones you specified in the compose-override.yml file. version: '3.6' services: mosquitto: container_name: mosquitto image: eclipse-mosquitto restart: unless-stopped user: \"1883\" ports: - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 volumes: - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./volumes/mosquitto/pwfile:/mosquitto/pwfile - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl Do note that it will replace the entire list, if you were to specify services: mosquitto: ports: - 1996:1996 Then the final output will be: version: '3.6' services: mosquitto: container_name: mosquitto image: eclipse-mosquitto restart: unless-stopped user: \"1883\" ports: - 1996:1996 volumes: - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./volumes/mosquitto/pwfile:/mosquitto/pwfile - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl Adding custom services Custom services can be added in a similar way to overriding default settings for standard services. Lets add a Minecraft and rcon server to IOTstack. Firstly, put the following into compose-override.yml : services: mosquitto: ports: - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 minecraft: image: itzg/minecraft-server ports: - \"25565:25565\" volumes: - \"./volumes/minecraft:/data\" environment: EULA: \"TRUE\" TYPE: \"PAPER\" ENABLE_RCON: \"true\" RCON_PASSWORD: \"PASSWORD\" RCON_PORT: 28016 VERSION: \"1.15.2\" REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES: \"TRUE\" ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX: \"CFG_\" CFG_DB_HOST: \"http://localhost:3306\" CFG_DB_NAME: \"IOTstack Minecraft\" CFG_DB_PASSWORD_FILE: \"/run/secrets/db_password\" restart: unless-stopped rcon: image: itzg/rcon ports: - \"4326:4326\" - \"4327:4327\" volumes: - \"./volumes/rcon_data:/opt/rcon-web-admin/db\" secrets: db_password: file: ./db_password Then create the service directory that the new instance will use to store persistant data: mkdir -p ./volumes/minecraft and mkdir -p ./volumes/rcon_data Obviously you will need to give correct folder names depending on the volumes you specify for your custom services. If your new service doesn't require persistant storage, then you can skip this step. Then simply run the ./menu.sh command, and rebuild the stack with what ever services you had before. Using the Mosquitto example above, the final docker-compose.yml file will look like: version: '3.6' services: mosquitto: ports: - 1996:1996 - 9001:9001 container_name: mosquitto image: eclipse-mosquitto restart: unless-stopped user: '1883' volumes: - ./volumes/mosquitto/data:/mosquitto/data - ./volumes/mosquitto/log:/mosquitto/log - ./services/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf - ./services/mosquitto/filter.acl:/mosquitto/config/filter.acl minecraft: image: itzg/minecraft-server ports: - 25565:25565 volumes: - ./volumes/minecraft:/data environment: EULA: 'TRUE' TYPE: PAPER ENABLE_RCON: 'true' RCON_PASSWORD: PASSWORD RCON_PORT: 28016 VERSION: 1.15.2 REPLACE_ENV_VARIABLES: 'TRUE' ENV_VARIABLE_PREFIX: CFG_ CFG_DB_HOST: http://localhost:3306 CFG_DB_NAME: IOTstack Minecraft CFG_DB_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password restart: unless-stopped rcon: image: itzg/rcon ports: - 4326:4326 - 4327:4327 volumes: - ./volumes/rcon_data:/opt/rcon-web-admin/db secrets: db_password: file: ./db_password Do note that the order of the YAML keys is not guaranteed.","title":"Custom services and overriding default settings for IOTstack"},{"location":"Custom/#custom-services-and-overriding-default-settings-for-iotstack","text":"You can specify modifcations to the docker-compose.yml file, including your own networks and custom containers/services.

The problem is best understood by example. In the following, you would expect ~ (tilde) to expand to /home/pi . It does: $ echo ~/IOTstack /home/pi/IOTstack The command below sends the same echo command to bash for execution. This is what happens when you type the name of a shell script. You get a new instance of bash to run the script: $ bash -c 'echo ~/IOTstack' /home/pi/IOTstack Same answer. Again, this is what you expect. But now try it with sudo on the front: $ sudo bash -c 'echo ~/IOTstack' /root/IOTstack The answer is different. It is different because sudo means \"become root, and then run the command\". The process of becoming root changes the home directory, and that changes the definition of ~ . Any script designed for working with IOTstack assumes ~ (or the equivalent $HOME variable) expands to /home/pi . That assumption is invalidated if the script is run by sudo . Of necessity, any script designed for working with IOTstack will have to invoke sudo inside the script when it is required . You do not need to second-guess the script's designer. Please try to minimise your use of sudo when you are working with IOTstack. Here are some rules of thumb: Is what you are about to run a script? If yes, check whether the script already contains sudo commands. Using menu.sh as the example: $ grep -c 'sudo' ~/IOTstack/menu.sh 28 There are 28 separate uses of sudo within menu.sh . That means the designer thought about when sudo was needed. Did the command you just executed work without sudo ? Note the emphasis on the past tense. If yes, then your work is done. If no, and the error suggests elevated privileges are necessary, then re-execute the last command like this: $ sudo !! It takes time, patience and practice to learn when sudo is actually needed. Over-using sudo out of habit, or because you were following a bad example you found on the web, is a very good way to find that you have created so many problems for yourself that will need to reinstall your IOTstack. Please err on the side of caution! Download the project You may need to install these support tools first: $ sudo apt install -y git curl It does no harm to re-install a package that is already installed. The command either behaves as an update or does nothing, as appropriate. IOTstack makes the following assumptions (the first three are Raspberry Pi defaults on a clean installation): You are logged-in as the user \"pi\" User \"pi\" has the user ID 1000 The home directory for user \"pi\" is /home/pi/ IOTstack is installed at /home/pi/IOTstack (with that exact spelling) Download IOTstack like this: $ cd $ git clone https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack.git IOTstack The Menu The menu is used to install Docker and then build the docker-compose.yml file which is necessary for starting the stack. The menu is only an aid. It is a good idea to learn the docker and docker-compose commands if you plan on using Docker in the long run. Menu item: Install Docker Please do not try to install docker and docker-compose via sudo apt install . There's more to it than that. Docker needs to be installed by menu.sh , like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Select \"Install Docker\" Follow the prompts. The process finishes by asking you to reboot. Do that! Menu item: Build Stack docker-compose uses a docker-compose.yml file to configure all your services. The docker-compose.yml file is created by the menu: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Select \"Build Stack\" Follow the on-screen prompts and select the containers you need. The best advice we can give is \"start small\". Limit yourself to the core containers you actually need (eg Mosquitto, Node-Red, InfluxDB, Grafana, Portainer). You can always add more containers later. Some users have gone overboard with their initial selections and have run into what seem to be Raspberry Pi OS limitations. The process finishes by asking you to bring up the stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d The first time you run up the stack docker will download all the images from Dockerhub. How long this takes will depend on how many containers you selected and the speed of your internet connection. Some containers also need to be built locally. Node-Red is an example. Depending on the Node-Red nodes you select, building the image can also take a very long time. This is especially true if you select the SQLite node. Be patient (and ignore the huge number of warnings). Menu item: Docker commands The commands in this menu execute shell scripts in the root of the project. It is not necessary to run the scripts from the menu. You can also look inside: ~/IOTstack/scripts and examine the files to see what they do. Menu item: Miscellaneous commands Some helpful commands have been added like disabling swap. Useful commands: docker \\& docker-compose Handy rules: docker commands can be executed from anywhere, but docker-compose commands need to be executed from within ~/IOTstack Starting your IOTstack To start the stack: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d Once the stack has been brought up, it will stay up until you take it down. This includes shutdowns and reboots of your Raspberry Pi. If you do not want the stack to start automatically after a reboot, you need to stop the stack before you issue the reboot command. Stopping your IOTstack Stopping aka \"downing\" the stack stops and deletes all containers, and removes the internal network: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose down To stop the stack without removing containers, run: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop stop can also be used to stop individual containers, like this: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop nodered there is no equivalent of down for a single container. Checking container status You can check the status of containers with: $ docker ps or $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose ps Viewing container logs You can inspect the logs of most containers like this: $ docker logs \u00abcontainer\u00bb for example: $ docker logs nodered You can also follow a container's log as new entries are added by using the -f flag: $ docker logs -f nodered Terminate with a Control+C. Note that restarting a container will also terminate a followed log. Restarting a container You can restart a container in several ways: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose restart \u00abcontainer\u00bb where \u00abcontainer\u00bb is the name of the container you want to restart, like this: $ docker-compose restart nodered This kind of restart is the least-powerful form of restart. A good way to think of it is \"the container is only restarted, it is not rebuilt\". If you change a docker-compose.yml setting for a container and/or an environment variable file referenced by docker-compose.yml then a restart is usually not enough to bring the change into effect. You need to make docker-compose notice the change: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb This type of \"restart\" rebuilds the container. Alternatively, to force a container to rebuild (without changing either docker-compose.yml or an environment variable file): $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop \u00abcontainer\u00bb $ docker-compose rm -f \u00abcontainer\u00bb $ docker-compose up -d \u00abcontainer\u00bb Persistent data Docker allows a container's designer to map folders inside a container to a folder on your disk (SD, SSD, HD). This is done with the \"volumes\" key in docker-compose.yml . Consider the following snippet for Node-Red: volumes: - ./volumes/nodered/data:/data You read this as two paths, separated by a colon. The: external path is ./volumes/nodered/data internal path is /data In this context, the leading \".\" means \"the folder containing docker-compose.yml , so the external path is actually: ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data If a process running inside the container modifies any file or folder within /data , the change is mirrored outside the container at the same relative path within ./volumes/nodered/data The same is true in reverse. Any change made to any file or folder within ./volumes/nodered/data outside the container is is mirrored in the same file or folder at /data inside the container. Deleting persistent data If you need a \"clean slate\" for a container, you can delete its volumes. Using InfluxDB as an example: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop influxdb $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/influxdb $ docker-compose up -d influxdb When docker-compose tries to bring up InfluxDB, it will notice this volume mapping in docker-compose.yml : volumes: - ./volumes/influxdb/data:/var/lib/influxdb and check to see whether ./volumes/influxdb/data is present. Finding it not there, it does the equivalent of: $ sudo mkdir -p ./volumes/influxdb/data When InfluxDB starts, it sees that the folder on right-hand-side of the volumes mapping ( /var/lib/influxdb ) is empty and initialises new databases. This is how most containers behave. But there are exceptions. A good example of an exception is Mosquitto. You can work out whether a container might be an exception by inspecting its services directory, like this: $ ls ~/IOTstack/services/mosquitto directoryfix.sh filter.acl mosquitto.conf service.yml terminal.sh $ The presence of directoryfix.sh is an indication that you may need to do a bit more than just erase a volumes directory. In the case of Mosquitto, simply running the directoryfix.sh will suffice, as in: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop mosquitto $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/mosquitto $ ./services/mosquitto/directoryfix.sh $ docker-compose up -d mosquitto directoryfix.sh recreates the folder structure expected by Mosquitto and gives it the correct permissions and ownership. Sharing files between the Pi and containers Have a look a the Wiki on how to share files between Node-RED and the Pi. Updating Docker images If a new version of a container image becomes available on Dockerhub, your local IOTstack can be updated by a pull command: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull $ docker-compose up -d The pull downloads any new images. It does this without disrupting the running stack. The up -d notices any newly-downloaded images, builds new containers, and swaps old-for-new. There is barely any downtime for affected containers. Updating images built from Dockerfiles Some containers are built by downloading a base image from DockerHub, and then applying a Dockerfile to build a local image. Node-Red is a good example of this. You can check if a container uses a Dockerfile by looking in its services directory: $ ls ~/IOTstack/services/\u00abcontainer\u00bb The directory will either contain a Dockerfile or it won't. You can also find out if a container is built using a Dockerfile by inspecting docker-compose.yml to see if the build key is present in the container's definition. To update a container that is built from a local image using a Dockerfile, proceed like this. First, figure out the name of the base image. Using Node-Red as the example, there are two candidates: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_nodered latest a38d38605ed4 22 hours ago 531MB nodered/node-red latest fa3bc6f20464 2 months ago 376MB It's practically guaranteed that the older image (the one created \"2 months ago\") is the base but you can confirm it by examining the first part of the Dockerfile: $ head -1 ~/IOTstack/services/nodered/Dockerfile FROM nodered/node-red:latest The image mentioned in the Dockerfile (\"nodered/node-red\") is the base image, while the other candidate (\"iotstack_nodered\") is the local image. To rebuild a local image, you usually need to remove the base image and then use a special form of the up command. Using Node-Red as the example: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker rmi \"nodered/node-red\" $ docker-compose up --build -d This pulls down the updated base image, builds a new local image by running the Dockerfile, creates the new container and swaps old-for-new. There is barely any downtime for the Node-Red service. Node-RED error after modifications to setup files If you get an error after you modify Node-Red's environment, it is because of how it is built (via Dockerfile). You can usually resolve the problem with: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose up --build -d Deleting unused images As your system evolves and new images come down from Dockerhub, you may find that more disk space is being occupied than you expected. Try running: $ docker system prune This recovers anything no longer in use. If you add a container via menu.sh and later remove it (either manually or via menu.sh ), the associated images(s) will probably persist. You can check which images are installed via: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE influxdb latest 1361b14bf545 5 days ago 264MB grafana/grafana latest b9dfd6bb8484 13 days ago 149MB iotstack_nodered latest 21d5a6b7b57b 2 weeks ago 540MB portainer/portainer-ce latest 5526251cc61f 5 weeks ago 163MB eclipse-mosquitto latest 4af162db6b4c 6 weeks ago 8.65MB nodered/node-red latest fa3bc6f20464 2 months ago 376MB portainer/portainer latest dbf28ba50432 2 months ago 62.5MB Both \"Portainer CE\" and \"Portainer\" are in that list. Assuming \"Portainer\" is no longer in use, it can be removed by using either its repository name or its Image ID. In other words, the following two commands are synonyms: $ docker rmi portainer/portainer $ docker rmi dbf28ba50432 In general, you can use the repository name to remove an image but the Image ID is sometimes needed. The most common situation where you are likely to need the Image ID is after an image has been updated on Dockerhub and pulled down to your Raspberry Pi. You will find two containers with the same name. One will be tagged \"latest\" (the running version) while the other will be tagged \" \" (the prior version). You use the Image ID to resolve the ambiguity. The nuclear option - use with caution You can use Git to delete all files and folders to return your folder to the freshly cloned state.

In the case of Mosquitto, simply running the directoryfix.sh will suffice, as in: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop mosquitto $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/mosquitto $ ./services/mosquitto/directoryfix.sh $ docker-compose up -d mosquitto directoryfix.sh recreates the folder structure expected by Mosquitto and gives it the correct permissions and ownership.","title":"Deleting persistent data"},{"location":"Getting-Started/#sharing-files-between-the-pi-and-containers","text":"Have a look a the Wiki on how to share files between Node-RED and the Pi.","title":"Sharing files between the Pi and containers"},{"location":"Getting-Started/#updating-docker-images","text":"If a new version of a container image becomes available on Dockerhub, your local IOTstack can be updated by a pull command: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose pull $ docker-compose up -d The pull downloads any new images.

Node-Red is a good example of this. You can check if a container uses a Dockerfile by looking in its services directory: $ ls ~/IOTstack/services/\u00abcontainer\u00bb The directory will either contain a Dockerfile or it won't. You can also find out if a container is built using a Dockerfile by inspecting docker-compose.yml to see if the build key is present in the container's definition. To update a container that is built from a local image using a Dockerfile, proceed like this. First, figure out the name of the base image. Using Node-Red as the example, there are two candidates: $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE iotstack_nodered latest a38d38605ed4 22 hours ago 531MB nodered/node-red latest fa3bc6f20464 2 months ago 376MB It's practically guaranteed that the older image (the one created \"2 months ago\") is the base but you can confirm it by examining the first part of the Dockerfile: $ head -1 ~/IOTstack/services/nodered/Dockerfile FROM nodered/node-red:latest The image mentioned in the Dockerfile (\"nodered/node-red\") is the base image, while the other candidate (\"iotstack_nodered\") is the local image. To rebuild a local image, you usually need to remove the base image and then use a special form of the up command. Using Node-Red as the example: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker rmi \"nodered/node-red\" $ docker-compose up --build -d This pulls down the updated base image, builds a new local image by running the Dockerfile, creates the new container and swaps old-for-new.

In simple terms, Docker is a software platform that simplifies the process of building, running, managing and distributing applications. It does this by virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running. The Problem Let\u2019s say you have three different Python-based applications that you plan to host on a single server (which could either be a physical or a virtual machine). Each of these applications makes use of a different version of Python, as well as the associated libraries and dependencies, differ from one application to another. Since we cannot have different versions of Python installed on the same machine, this prevents us from hosting all three applications on the same computer. The Solution Let\u2019s look at how we could solve this problem without making use of Docker. In such a scenario, we could solve this problem either by having three physical machines, or a single physical machine, which is powerful enough to host and run three virtual machines on it. Both the options would allow us to install different versions of Python on each of these machines, along with their associated dependencies. The machine on which Docker is installed and running is usually referred to as a Docker Host or Host in simple terms. So, whenever you plan to deploy an application on the host, it would create a logical entity on it to host that application. In Docker terminology, we call this logical entity a Container or Docker Container to be more precise. Whereas the kernel of the host\u2019s operating system is shared across all the containers that are running on it. This allows each container to be isolated from the other present on the same host. Thus it supports multiple containers with different application requirements and dependencies to run on the same host, as long as they have the same operating system requirements. Docker Terminology Docker Images and Docker Containers are the two essential things that you will come across daily while working with Docker. In simple terms, a Docker Image is a template that contains the application, and all the dependencies required to run that application on Docker. On the other hand, as stated earlier, a Docker Container is a logical entity. In more precise terms, it is a running instance of the Docker Image. What is Docker-Compose? Docker Compose provides a way to orchestrate multiple containers that work together. Docker compose is a simple yet powerful tool that is used to run multiple containers as a single service. For example, suppose you have an application which requires Mqtt as a communication service between IOT devices and OpenHAB instance as a Smarthome application service. In this case by docker-compose, you can create one single file (docker-compose.yml) which will create both the containers as a single service without starting each separately. It wires up the networks (literally), mounts all volumes and exposes the ports. The IOTstack with the templates and menu is a generator for that docker-compose service descriptor. How Docker Compose Works? use yaml files to configure application services (docker-compose.yaml) can start all the services with a single command ( docker-compose up ) can stop all the service with a single command ( docker-compose down ) How are the containers connected The containers are automagically connected when we run the stack with docker-compose up. The containers using same logical network (by default) where the instances can access each other with the instance logical name. Means if there is an instance called mosquitto and an openhab , when openHAB instance need to access mqtt on that case the domain name of mosquitto will be resolved as the runnuning instance of mosquitto. How the container are connected to host machine Volumes The containers are enclosed processes which state are lost with the restart of container. To be able to persist states volumes (images or directories) can be used to share data with the host. Which means if you need to persist some database, configuration or any state you have to bind volumes where the running service inside the container will write files to that binded volume. In order to understand what a Docker volume is, we first need to be clear about how the filesystem normally works in Docker. Docker images are stored as series of read-only layers. When we start a container, Docker takes the read-only image and adds a read-write layer on top. If the running container modifies an existing file, the file is copied out of the underlying read-only layer and into the top-most read-write layer where the changes are applied. The version in the read-write layer hides the underlying file, but does not destroy it -- it still exists in the underlying layer. When a Docker container is deleted, relaunching the image will start a fresh container without any of the changes made in the previously running container -- those changes are lost, thats the reason that configs, databases are not persisted, Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker. In IOTstack project uses the volumes directory in general to bind these container volumes. Ports When containers running a we would like to delegate some services to the outside world, for example OpenHAB web frontend have to be accessible for users. There are several ways to achive that. One is mounting the port to the most machine, this called port binding. On that case service will have a dedicated port which can be accessed, one drawback is one host port can be used one serice only. Another way is reverse proxy. The term reverse proxy (or Load Balancer in some terminology) is normally applied to a service that sits in front of one or more servers (in our case containers), accepting requests from clients for resources located on the server(s). From the client point of view, the reverse proxy appears to be the web server and so is totally transparent to the remote user. Which means several service can share same port the server will route the request by the URL (virtual domain or context path). For example, there is grafana and openHAB instances, where the opeanhab.domain.tld request will be routed to openHAB instance 8181 port while grafana.domain.tld to grafana instance 3000 port. On that case the proxy have to be mapped for host port 80 and/or 444 on host machine, the proxy server will access the containers via the docker virtual network.

Distilling it down Before Grafana is launched for the first time: GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER has a default value of \"admin\". You can explicitly set it to \"admin\" or some other value. Whatever option you choose then that's the account name of Grafana's administrative user. But choosing any value other than \"admin\" is probably a bad idea. GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD has a default value of \"admin\". You can explicitly set it to \"admin\" or some other value. If its value is \"admin\" then you will be forced to change it the first time you login to Grafana. If its value is something other than \"admin\" then that will be the password until you change it via the web UI. These two environment keys only work for the first launch of Grafana. Once Grafana has been launched, you can never change either the username or the password by editing grafana.env . For this reason, it is better to leave grafana.env in its shrink-wrapped state. Your first login is as \"admin/admin\" and then you set the password you actually want when Grafana prompts you to change it. HELP \u2013 I forgot my Grafana admin password! Assuming your IOTstack is up, the magic incantation is: $ docker exec grafana grafana-cli --homepath \"/usr/share/grafana\" admin reset-admin-password \"admin\" Then, use a browser to connect to your Raspberry Pi on port 3000. Grafana will: Expect you login as user \"admin\" with password \"admin\"; and then Force you to change the default password to something else.

It might work anyway but we haven't tested it. Sorry. But that's why we said changing the username was not recommended. Overriding Grafana settings Grafana documentation contains a list of settings . Settings are described in terms of how they appear in \".ini\" files. An example of the sort of thing you might want to do is to enable anonymous access to your Grafana dashboards. The Grafana documentation describes this in \".ini\" format as: [auth.anonymous] enabled = true # Organization name that should be used for unauthenticated users org_name = Main Org. # Role for unauthenticated users, other valid values are `Editor` and `Admin` org_role = Viewer \".ini\" format is not really appropriate in a Docker context. Instead, you use environment variables to override Docker's settings. Environment variables are placed in ~/IOTstack/services/grafana/grafana.env . You need to convert \".ini\" format to environment variable syntax. The rules are: Start with \"GF_\", then Append the [section name], replacing any periods with underscores, then Append the section key \"as is\", then Append an \"=\", then Append the right hand side in quotes. Applying those rules gets you: GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=\"true\" GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_NAME=\"Main Org.\" GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=\"Viewer\" It is not strictly necessary to encapsulate every right hand side value in quotes. In the above, both \"true\" and \"Viewer\" would work without quotes, whereas \"Main Org.\" needs quotes because of the embedded space. After you have changed ~/IOTstack/services/grafana/grafana.env , you need to propagate the changes into the Grafana container: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop grafana $ docker-compose up -d In theory, the second command could be omitted, or both the second and third commands could be replaced with \"docker-compose restart grafana\" but experience suggests stopping the container is more reliable. A slightly more real-world example would involve choosing a different default organisation name for anonymous access. This example uses \"ChezMoi\". First, the environment key needs to be set to that value: GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_NAME=ChezMoi Then that change needs to be propagated into the Grafana container as explained above. Next, Grafana needs to be told that \"ChezMoi\" is the default organisation: Use your browser to login to Grafana as an administrator. From the \"Server Admin\" slide-out menu on the left hand side, choose \"Orgs\". In the list that appears, click on \"Main Org\". This opens an editing panel. Change the \"Name\" field to \"ChezMoi\" and click \"Update\". Sign-out of Grafana. You will be taken back to the login screen.

It is able to track and control all devices at home and offer a platform for automating control. Port binding is 8123 . Hass.io is exposed to your hosts' network in order to discover devices on your LAN. That means that it does not sit inside docker's network. To avoid confusion There are 2 versions of Home Assistant: Hass.io and Home Assistant Docker. Hass.io uses its own orchastration with 3 docker images: hassio_supervisor , hassio_dns and homeassistant . Home Assistant Docker runs inside a single docker image, and doesn't support all the features that Hass.io does (such as add-ons). IOTstack currently only has Hass.io and we can only offer limited configuration of it since it is its own platform. More info on versions . Both Hass.io and Home Assistant Docker can be found on the experimental branch of IOTstack. Menu installation Hass.io now has a seperate installation in the menu. The old version was incorrect and should be removed. Be sure to update you project and install the correct version. You will be asked to select you device type during the installation. Hass.io is no longer dependant on the IOTstack, it has its own service for maintaining its uptime. Installation Due to the behaviour of Network Manager, it is strongly recomended to connect the Pi over a wired internet connection, rather than WiFi. If you ignore the advice about connecting via Ethernet and install Network Manager while your session is connected via WiFi, your connection will freeze part way through the installation (when Network Manager starts running and unconditionally changes your Raspberry Pi's WiFi MAC address). Ensure your system is up to date with: sudo apt update If not already installed, install the network manager with: sudo apt-get install network-manager apparmor-utils before running the hass.io installation to avoid any potential errors.

That permission structure will still work if you change Mosquitto to run with root privileges. However, running as root may have the side effect of changing privilege levels within volumes/mosquitto . Keep this in mind if you decide to switch back to running Mosquitto as user 1883 because it is less likely to work. Port 9001 In earlier versions of IOTstack, service.yml included two port mappings which were included in docker-compose.yml when Mosquitto was chosen in the menu: ports: - \"1883:1883\" - \"9001:9001\" Issue 67 explored the topic of port 9001 and showed that: The base image for mosquitto did not expose port 9001; and The running container was not listening to port 9001.

This is completely normal behaviour. SQLite Thanks to @fragolinux the SQLite node will install now. WARNING it will output many error and will look as if it has gotten stuck. Just give it time and it will continue. GPIO To communicate to your Pi's GPIO you need to use the node-red-node-pi-gpiod node. It allowes you to connect to multiple Pis from the same nodered service. You need to make sure that pigpdiod is running. The recommended method is listed here You run the following command sudo nano /etc/rc.local and add the line /usr/bin/pigpiod above exit 0 and reboot the Pi. There is an option to secure the service see the writeup for further instuctions. Fot the Rpi Image you will also need to update to the most recent version sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install pigpio python-pigpio python3-pigpio Drop the gpio node and use your Pi's IP. Example: 192.168.1.123 (127.0.0.1 won't work because this is the local address of every computer'.) Securing Node-RED To secure Node-RED you need a password hash. There is a terminal script ./services/nodered/terminal.sh execute it to get into the terminal. Copy the helper text node -e ..... PASSWORD , paste it and change your password to get a hash. Open the file ./volumes/nodered/data/settings.js and follow the writeup on https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/securing-node-red for further instructions Sharing files between Node-RED and the host Containers run in a sandboxed environment they can't see the host (the Pi itself) file system. This presents a problem if you want to read a file directly to the host from inside the container. Fortunately there is a method, the containers have been set up with volume mapping. The volume maps a specific directory or file from the host file system into the container. Therefore if you write to that directory both the host and the container can see the files. Consider the following: The docker-compose.yml file shows the following for Node-RED volumes: - ./volumes/nodered/data:/data If inside Node-RED you were to write to the /data folder then the host would see it in ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data (the ./volumes above implies relative to the docker-compose.yml file) The flow writes the file /data/test.txt and it is visible in the host as ~/IOTstack/volumes/nodered/data/test.txt Remember, files and directories in the volume are persistent between restarts. If you save your data elsewhere it will be destroyed should you restart. Creating a subdirectory in volume i.e. /data/storage/ would be advised Using Bluetooth In order to allow Node-RED to access the Pi's Bluetooth module the docker-comose.yml file needs to be modified to allow it access. network_mode: \"host\" needs to be added (make sure the indentation is correct, us spaces not tabs): nodered: container_name: nodered build: ./services/nodered/. restart: unless-stopped user: \"0\" network_mode: \"host\" By activating host mode the Node-RED container can no longer access containers by name http://influxdb:8086 will no longer work.

Running the exec node against the host Pi Due to the isolation between containers and the host the exec node will run against the container. There is a solution to work around this.

It is a successor to Portainer . According to the Portainer CE documentation Portainer 1.24.x will continue as a separate code branch, released as portainer/portainer:latest, and will receive ongoing security updates until at least 1st Sept 2021. No new features will be added beyond what was available in 1.24.1. From that it should be clear that Portainer is deprecated and that Portainer CE is the way forward. Portainer CE coexistence with Portainer IOTstack has been set up so that Portainer CE and Portainer can coexist. This is intended as a short-term migration aid rather than a long-term proposition. If you are a first-time user of IOTstack, you should choose Portainer CE and forget about Portainer . Installing Portainer CE Run the menu: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ ./menu.sh Choose \"Build Stack\", select \"Portainer-ce\", press [TAB] then \"\\<Ok>\" and follow through to the end of the menu process, typically choosing \"Do not overwrite\" for any existing services. When the menu finishes: $ docker-compose up -d Ignore any message like this: WARNING: Found orphan containers (portainer) for this project \u2026 Migration note Portainer CE and Portainer use different locations for their persistent data: Edition Persistent Data Directory Reference Portainer ~/IOTstack/volumes/portainer [A] Portainer CE ~/IOTstack/volumes/portainer-ce [B] If you have been running Portainer but have never run Portainer CE then: [A] will exist, but [B] will not exist. Whenever \"Portainer-ce\" is enabled in menu.sh , a check is made for the presence of [A] combined with the absence [B]. If and only if that situation exists, [B] is initialised as a copy of [A].

Thereafter, any settings you change in Portainer CE will not be reflected in Portainer , nor vice versa. Port Number = 9002 Both Portainer CE and Portainer are usually configured to listen to port 9000 but, in the IOTstack implementation: Portainer CE uses port 9002; and Portainer uses port 9000. You can always change the port numbers in your docker-compose.yml . First run of Portainer CE In your web browser navigate to #yourip:9002/ . If you are migrating from Portainer : review the Migration note which explains why your Portainer credentials will likely apply to Portainer CE , and then supply your Portainer credentials. If you are not migrating from Portainer : the first screen will suggest a username of \"admin\" and ask for a password. Supply those credentials and click \"Create User\". the second screen will ask you to select a connection method. For IOTstack, \"Docker (Manage the local Docker environment)\" is usually appropriate so click that and then click \"Connect\". From there, you can click on the \"Local\" group and take a look around. One of the things Portainer CE can help you do is find unused containers but beware of reading too much into this because, sometimes, an \"unused\" container is actually the base for another container (eg Node-Red). There are 'Quick actions' to view logs and other stats. This can all be done from terminal commands but Portainer CE makes it easier. Ceasing use of Portainer As soon as you are happy that Portainer CE meets your needs, you can dispense with Portainer . IOTstack only has limited support for getting rid of unwanted services so you should do the following. Stop Portainer from running and remove its image: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ docker-compose stop portainer $ docker-compose rm -f portainer $ docker rmi portainer/portainer Either: run menu.sh choose \"Build Stack\" de-select \"portainer\", and follow through to the end choosing \"Do not overwrite\" for existing services, or: edit docker-compose.yml and remove these lines: portainer: container_name: portainer image: portainer/portainer restart: unless-stopped ports: - \"9000:9000\" volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock - ./volumes/portainer/data:/data edit services/selection.txt and remove this line: portainer Tidy-up: $ cd ~/IOTstack $ rm -rf ./services/portainer $ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/portainer Setting the Public IP address for your end-point If you click on a \"Published Port\" in the \"Containers\" list, your browser may return an error saying something like \"can't connect to server\" associated with an IP address of \"0.0.0.0\". To fix that problem, proceed as shown below: Click \"Endpoints\" in the left hand panel. Click the name \"local\" in the list of Endpoints. Click in the \"Public IP\" field. Enter one of the following: The multicast DNS (MDNS) name of your Raspberry Pi (eg iot-hub.local ) The fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Raspberry Pi (eg iot-hub.mydomain.com ) The IP address of your Raspberry Pi (eg 192.168.1.10 ) Click \"Update endpoint\". To remove the Public IP address, repeat the above steps but clear the \"Public IP\" field in step 3. The reason why you have to tell Portainer CE which Public IP address to use is because an instance of Portainer CE does not necessarily have to be running on the same Raspberry Pi as the Docker containers it is managing. Keep in mind that clicking on a \"Published Port\" does not guarantee that your browser can open a connection. For example: Port 1883 for Mosquitto expects MQTT packets.

It can securely connect you to your home network, allowing you to access your home network's local services from anywhere. It can also secure your traffic when using public internet connections. WARNING: These instructions require that you have privileges to configure your network's gateway. If you are not able to make changes to your network's firewall settings, then you will not be able to finish this setup. If you are able to make these changes, then proceed to the next steps. Setup There are a few things to configure before starting up the WireGuard container. First, it may be necessary to set up a way to locate your home network from the internet. One way to achieve this, if you haven't done so yet, is to set up a DuckDNS account as described in the Wiki under the section DuckDNS. This address will be used in the following configuration. After configuring the service, it needs to be made accessible from outside the home network. Lastly, each device will need WireGuard installed and set up with the details of your WireGuard service. WireGuard Configuration The Custom services and overriding default settings for IOTstack page describes how to use a compose-override.yml file to allow ./menu.sh to automatically incorporate your custom configurations into the final docker-compose.yml file that is responsible for defining all service containers. You will need to create the compose-override.yml before building your stack via ./menu.sh . If you have already built your stack, you'll have to re-build it after creating compose-override.yml . Here is an example compose-override.yml file: services: wireguard: environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=America/Los_Angeles - SERVERURL=<Your-DuckDNS-account>.duckdns.org #optional - SERVERPORT=51820 #optional - PEERS=3 #optional - PEERDNS=auto #optional - INTERNAL_SUBNET=100.64.0.0/24 #optional The values you will probably want to change are TZ to your own timezone, SERVERURL to your own DuckDNS address and PEERS to set the number of devices you plan to connect to your VPN. If you also decide to edit the SERVERPORT value, you will also need to include a matching value in the ports: section as follows: services: wireguard: environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=America/Los_Angeles - SERVERURL=<Your-DuckDNS-account>.duckdns.org #optional - SERVERPORT=55555 #optional - PEERS=3 #optional - PEERDNS=auto #optional - INTERNAL_SUBNET=100.64.0.0/24 #optional ports: - 55555:55555/udp If you customize other containers, just make sure the file only says services: once at the beginning of the file. Once you are done, you can run ./menu.sh to build your stack. Finally, check that your changes were successfully integrated by running: $ cat docker-compose.yml If everything looks good, you can run the following to start your container: $ docker-compose up -d Network Configuration A typical home network will have a firewall configured that effectively blocks all incoming attempts to open a new connection with devices on the network. However, in order to use our VPN from outside of our home network (which is precisely the point of running the service!), we need to configure port fowarding to allow incoming connections to reach our device running IOTstack. This step of the configuration varies based on the specific gateway device for your network. Note that these instructions assume you have privileges to configure your gateway's firewall settings (see warning above). This section will include some tips, but if you are unsure how to do this, the best idea would be to search the web for \"[YOUR DEVICE NAME] port forwarding configuration\". NOTE: WireGuard uses UDP, not TCP. So make sure your port forwarding rules are for UDP only. First, it's a good idea to check that WireGuard is at least accessible on the local network by using nmap : $ sudo nmap -sU -p 51820 ip.of.IOTstack.device OR from the IOTstack device itself: $ sudo nmap -sU -p 51820 127.0.0.1 PORT STATE SERVICE 51820/udp open|filtered unknown MAC Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Unknown) If your result looks similar, then WireGuard is up and running and you simply need to set up port forwarding. Notice again, that WireGuard uses UDP. Many routers/gateways are configurable via a web interface, in which case you will only need the ip address of the device, as well as the account and password to access it. You should be able to find your gateway's address with the following command: $ ip route | grep default default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100 Then copy the ip to a browser window to configure. The login credentials may be physically printed on the device if you have never logged in or changed the default credentials. Follow the instructions to configure UDP port forwarding for your network. Make sure that you configure only UDP port forwarding, only pointing specifically at your IOTstack device (by ip or hostname, whichever is more appropriate for your network configuration) and only for port 51820 (or whichever port you have configured for WireGuard). Remember that you are opening this port to the public internet, so be careful not to leave anything open that you're not using or point to the wrong device. Once you are finished, save your changes and test that the port is open from the internet, again using nmap : $ sudo nmap -sU -p 51820 <your-duckdns-account>.duckdns.org PORT STATE SERVICE 51820/udp open|filtered unknown MAC Address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (Unknown) If everything looks good, then the last step is to set up your devices to connect to your WireGuard service. Device Setup Lastly, it's time to set up each device to connect to your VPN. You will need to install the WireGuard client on each device. This can be typically be done via each device's app store or package manager. For complete install instructions, see the WireGuard Installation page . QR Code Mobile Device Setup After the client is installed on your devices, each one needs its own WireGuard peer configuration. The easiest devices to set up are mobile devices, which can be done by using the QR codes that are automatically generated for each WireGuard PEER, as defined in the docker-compose.yml file. The QR codes are located in the following locations: ~/IOTstack/services/wireguard/config/peer1/peer1.png ~/IOTstack/services/wireguard/config/peer2/peer2.png ~/IOTstack/services/wireguard/config/peer3/peer3.png ... To copy the files from a Raspberry Pi onto another Linux machine for example, you can use the following command: $ sudo scp pi@<Rpi-ip-address>:/home/pi/IOTstack/services/wireguard/config/peer1/peer1.png ~/peer1.png (Hint: you can use the scp -i flag to specify an IdentityFile or better yet, scp -F flag if you have your device configured in .ssh/config ) You can repeat this step for each peer's QR code .png file and then scan the QR codes in the mobile app on your devices. The devices should now be configured and able to connect to your VPN. Setting Up Other Devices Setting up other devices is a bit more complicated.
